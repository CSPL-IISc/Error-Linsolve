# Error-Linsolve
Error estimators for linear solvers -
The demands of accuracy in measurements and engineering models today, renders the condition number of problems larger. While a corresponding increase in the precision of floating point numbers ensured a stable computing, the uncertainty in convergence when using residue as a stopping criterion has increased. The codes present an analysis of the uncertainty in convergence when using relative residue as a stopping criterion for iterative solution of linear systems. Estimators of error in the GMRES and the naive Bi-CG algorithms are demonstrated. The robust performance of these estimates as a stopping criterion results in increased savings and accuracy in computation, as condition number and size of problems increase.

Keywords: error; stopping criteria; condition number; Conjugate Gradients; Bi-CG;
